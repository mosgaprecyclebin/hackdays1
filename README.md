Goals
-----

The goals of this hackevent are to have a basic code base for one or more
of the following aspects:

- Apps that read sensor data and transmit them, with the user's consent,
  for scientific purposes (distributed measurements); preprocessing might be
  necessary, e.g. using microphones for measuring noise levels in cities,
  but not recording what people are saying
- Apps for conducting scientific experiments with human subjects
- Games with a scientific purpose: visual interface, interactivity, multi-person
  games, real-time transmission of data between players; recording gaming data
  for scientific analysis
- Simple way for users to give informed consent and to download their own data
  for the sake of transparency and sharing
